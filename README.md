# Guess Who HTML

A simple Guess Who style game implemented in HTML. I created it so my TTRPG group could play Guess Who using our various player characters.

[See it in action.](https://d16-nichevo.github.io/guess-who-html)

One player uses the page to set up a game. That player can then share the game link to other players. There's no networking or other communication between pages, it's expected players have their own way to communicate (speaking IRL or voice chat) and that they don't cheat.

# Building Your Own

Feel free to use this code to create your own version of the game.

Changes you will most likely want to make:

1. Change the JavaScript variables `facePath` and `faces` to use your own face images.
   * Face images are not in source control as they are for demonstration purposes only.
1. Get rid of the banner, and formatting specific to the banner.
